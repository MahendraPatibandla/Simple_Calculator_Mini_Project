# Simple_Calculator_Mini_Project
Added Simple Calculator project – my first Python mini project!

🧮 Simple Calculator – Python Mini Project

This is my first mini project as part of my Data Science journey.  
A basic calculator built using Python in Jupyter Notebook (Colab) that performs:

✅ Addition  
✅ Subtraction  
✅ Multiplication  
✅ Division  

## 📌 Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Purpose
To apply my understanding of Python fundamentals, functions, and user interaction.  
This marks the beginning of my practical learning in Data Science.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Python input/output
- Function creation
- Error handling (optional if you added it)
- Logical thinking

## 📁 File
- `Simple_Calculator_Program.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the full code.

**Next Step:** I’ll continue building more real-world mini projects to deepen my understanding of data and logic.
